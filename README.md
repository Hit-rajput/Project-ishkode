# Ishkode-Forest fire prediction
Forest fires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, wildlife, and human lives. Early detection and accurate prediction of forest fires are crucial for effective fire management and mitigation. In this project, we aim to develop an intelligent forest fire prediction system leveraging the power of machine learning (ML) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to enhance predictive accuracy and timeliness.



## Objectives

- Develop a robust dataset comprising historical forest fire data including environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and vegetation type.
- Implement machine learning algorithms for feature selection, classification, and regression tasks to analyze and predict forest fire occurrences.
- Integrate evolutionary algorithms to optimize model parameters and improve prediction accuracy over time.
- Design a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring and visualization of forest fire risk areas.
## Dataset References

The project utilizes the following dataset(s) for reference:

 - [Canadian National Fire Databse(CNFDB) ](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart)
 - [Cortez,Paulo and Morais,Anbal. (2008). Forest Fires. UCI Machine Learning Repository. ](https://doi.org/10.24432/C5D88D.)
 - [Nasa MODIS Dataset](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/)

 In future iterations, we plan to develop a robust dataset comprising historical forest fire data. This dataset will include environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and vegetation type. By incorporating these variables, we aim to enhance the accuracy and predictive capabilities of our project.
